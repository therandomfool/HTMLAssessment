# HTMLAssessment

- Use the text editor of your choice to begin assessment.html as a correctly structured HTML document skeleton, including a document title.

- Inside of this document you are going to be adding elements with their respective section headers, demonstrating your knowledge of basic HTML markup.

- An example of the finished product can be found here.

- (Note: it is not very good looking. That's where CSS will come into play.)

- Add a second-level section header "TEXT", and under it three paragraphs. The second paragraph should be formatted as a block quotation and emphasized. The first word of each paragraph should be in bold.

- Add another section header with the title "TABLE" with data to simulate a game score for the Broncos. Creating a table similar to the one shown below, using both colspan and rowspan attributes. Don't worry about styling it, just lay out a table that follows the pattern. Give the table a header, footer, and caption.

- HTML Table

- Create a section header with the title of "LIST". Create a list that organizes the teams by team name, position, and player. Use the default bullets that are provided with an HTML list item.
HTML List

- Modify the team names above so they are links to the team home pages. (Be sure to test your links.)

- Locate logos for each team (Wikipedia is a good source) and use the URLs to place each element next to the team name in the list above. Use width and/or height attributes to size it to thumbnail size.

- Add a new section with the heading "FORM". Under it create a form element. Inside of the form add:

- Give the form input text fields for firstname and lastname.
Add a drop-down options list that allows the user to select their favorite sport from a predefined list.
Add checkboxes indicating whether they have ever personally played/attended/coached/bet on this sport.
Add a radio button group indicating whether they prefer the amateur, college, or professional version.
Add a submit button.
Use br tags for basic formatting.


# CSSAssessment

- User Story #1
- Your headers should be changed to your favorite color and set to a sans-serif font. (Notice they are not all the same tag!)

- User Story #2
- Your table should have bold/colored table headers, as well as a table border. Content should be centered in their respective blocks.

- User Story #3
- Your list should have square list bullets.

- User Story #4
- When the user hovers over a hyperlink the background color of the hyperlink should change and it should not be underlined.

- User Story #5
- Set the background color of the block quote text (second paragraph) to a dark color and the font color to a contrasting light color.

- User Story #6
- Make each team's image the background image for the list. Hint Check out the element > element and :first-child / :last-child selectors. Remove the image from above the team's list.

- User Story #7
- The checkbox list should not be bulleted.

- Stretch Goals
- Have each team's primary quarterback display in bold.

- Use CSS to give the table rows alternating background colors.

- Solid background images can make foreground text hard to read; find a way to have each team's image display behind its roster, but reduced intensity. Do not edit the image itself.
