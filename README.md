- User Story #1
- Your headers should be changed to your favorite color and set to a sans-serif font. (Notice they are not all the same tag!)

- User Story #2
- Your table should have bold/colored table headers, as well as a table border. Content should be centered in their respective blocks.

- User Story #3
- Your list should have square list bullets.

- User Story #4
- When the user hovers over a hyperlink the background color of the hyperlink should change and it should not be underlined.

- User Story #5
- Set the background color of the block quote text (second paragraph) to a dark color and the font color to a contrasting light color.

- User Story #6
- Make each team's image the background image for the list. Hint Check out the element > element and :first-child / :last-child selectors. Remove the image from above the team's list.

- User Story #7
- The checkbox list should not be bulleted.

- Stretch Goals
- Have each team's primary quarterback display in bold.

- Use CSS to give the table rows alternating background colors.

- Solid background images can make foreground text hard to read; find a way to have each team's image display behind its roster, but reduced intensity. Do not edit the image itself.
